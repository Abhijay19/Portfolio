<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, Im Abhijay Sekhar Chodhury based off Guwahati, India. I'm an adventurous individual who enjoys taking risks in life
  and am a person who believes that a fit body is a fit mind. I'm really into woking out and bodybuilding is one of my 
  greatest hobbies. Engaging in lifting heavy loads establishes a spiritual connection between me and my soul and a life 
  without the gymnasium is a life which is pretty unimaginable to me.
</p>

<p>My other hobbies also include playing the guitar. Being a rock and metal listener since the age of 10, i have always been 
  fascinated by the electric guitar and i have started playing it since my early teenage years. I also love playing computer games and 
  listening to a wide variety of music belonging to differnet genres.
